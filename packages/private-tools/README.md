# `private-tools`

These tools are open sourced, but the purposes of the tools are intentionally omitted.

Some tools have some hidden parts that's only locally available to Sam. Sam tries to make most of
the supporting libraries of these tools available.

Most of the tools here are not used for managing websites.
