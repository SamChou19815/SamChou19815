# Welcome to My Blog!

This is the zeroth post in my blog. Since the content of the post might change when I migrate the
blog from one place to another, I choose to set the time to be `1970-01-01`.

It is a Hello World post, but I will also use this post to test various features of
[Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus).

<!--truncate-->

Here is a Hello World code snippet in my own programming language
[samlang](https://github.com/SamChou19815/samlang) that is currently under development:

```samlang
class Main {
  function main(): unit = println("Hello, Sam!")
}
```
