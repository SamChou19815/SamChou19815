# Welcome to My Blog!

This is the zeroth post in my blog. Since the content of the post might change when I migrate the
blog from one place to another, I choose to set the time to be `1970-01-01`.

Here is a Hello World code snippet in my own programming language
[samlang](https://github.com/SamChou19815/samlang):

```samlang
class Main {
  function main(): unit = println("Hello, Sam!")
}
```

There are some TypeScript code snippets that I use to help testing syntax highlighting:

```typescript
function bar() {}
function foo<T>() {
  true;
}
class BBB {
  help<T>() {}
}
foo.bar;
```
