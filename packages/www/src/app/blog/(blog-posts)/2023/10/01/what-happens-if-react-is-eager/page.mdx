TLDR: Absolute Chaos

## Why you might want this occasionally

We know that React evaluates JSX lazily. JSX is not a function call, but a spec of what should be rendered. This kind of declarative style of programming works really well for vast majority of cases, but it does not solve all problems.

Once in a while, you might want to inspect what will be rendered to make rendering decisions. Maybe you want to figure out whether certain components are rendered, or whether the stuff you want to render is actually rendered.

```tsx
import type {ReactNode} from 'react';

function MyFlexibleContainer(
  {children}: {children: ReactNode},
) {
  if (childrenHasMaterialDesignElements(children)) {
    return (
      <MaterialDesignContainer>
        {children}
      </MaterialDesignContainer>
    );
  }

  return <div>{children}</div>;
}
```

How do you implement the function `childrenHasMaterialDesignElements`? It turns out that you can't. If you are willing to settle on single-level inspection, you can (which you probably shouldn't) inspect the internals of JSX. A JSX element is just a plain object where the `type` field can tell you which component will be rendered. This strategy breaks down when a material design component is wrapped in another component.

```tsx
function MyWrappedMaterialButton() {
  return (
    <MaterialButton onClick={() => alert("Ouch")}>
      Ouch
    </MaterialButton>
  );
}
```

The actual representation of `<MyWrappedMaterialButton />` is something along the line of `{ type: MyWrappedMaterialButton, props: {}, ... }`, which tells you nothing about whether `MyWrappedMaterialButton` will eventually render some material design components.

Why doesn't React provide some API that will allow the deep inspection? After all, what's requested here seems to be pretty benign. Everything remains a pure function. We will explore in the next section why it will be a bad idea.

## A Hypothetical Hook

The core issue here is that we have no way to tell React to eagarly evaluate a JSX element. It might be tempting to call the component yourself if you know you exclusively use function components. For actual stateless components, it might work, but as soon as you use builtin hooks, things will break down pretty quickly.

It might happen to work in simple cases:

```tsx
function Foo() {
  useState();

  return <div />;
}

function Bar() {
  // Foo behaves like a custom hook,
  // and it's on the toplevel.
  return <div>{Foo()}</div>;
}
```

However, as soon as you have more complicated cases, there will be absolute chaos:

```tsx
function Foo() {
  useState();

  return <div />;
}

function Bar({cond}: {cond: boolean}) {
  // Behaves like conditional hook usage.
  const e = cond && Foo();

  return <div>{e}</div>;
}
```

Well, it clearly doesn't work today. However, let's assume that the React team is on your side, and provides a new first-class hook `useFullyResolvedJSX` that knows how to handle states and effects, so you can write

```tsx
import type {ReactNode} from 'react';
import {useFullyResolvedJSX} from 'react';

function MyFlexibleContainer(
  {children}: {children: ReactNode},
) {
  const resolved = useFullyResolvedJSX(children);

  if (childrenHasMaterialDesignElements(resolved)) {
    return (
      <MaterialDesignContainer>
        {resolved}
      </MaterialDesignContainer>
    );
  }

  return <div>{resolved}</div>;
}
```

Since you have a fully resolved view of `children`, you can finally write a reliable implementation of `childrenHasMaterialDesignElements` that finds material design elements deeply in the children, regardless of how many times it is wrapped.

It sounds like that we already figured out the API design that solves an actual need. We just need to find ways to get this into the core of React, right?

## Leaky Abstraction

I intentionally omitted the return type declaration of `useFullyResolvedJSX`, since it's actually not easy to figure it out. What's the nature of the returned `resolved` value? It cannot be a JSX, since that's where we started from. We can infer from the hypothetical usage that the value can be rendered. Since we want to inspect the value, the structure might be something like:

```js
{
  type: MyWrappedMaterialButton,
  props: {},
  renders: {
    type: MaterialButton,
    props: {...}
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

I made a hand-waving assumption of React knows how to handle states well with this API. But is it really possible?

We can start by asking the question: is the return value of `useFullyResolvedJSX` stateful? Remember that somewhere in the input JSX tree, `useState` might be called, and the returned value is being depended on during render. In a subsequent re-render, we don't want to throw away the state and start fresh completely. Therefore, the returned value has to be stateful.

For the first time, you get a handle of a stateful React component instance. This is where the harm of this hypothetical API becomes obvious. While we can use static typing to prevent further inspection on mutable state, you can already create a mess with some very innocent code. e.g.

```tsx
function MyFlexibleContainer(
  {children}: {children: ReactNode},
) {
  const resolved = useFullyResolvedJSX(children);

  return (
    <MaterialDesignContainer>
      {resolved}
      {resolved}
    </MaterialDesignContainer>
  )
}
```

Here, we make a shallow copy of `resolved` and render both. Now we have two instances sharing the same state being rendered. Once there is a `setState`, should both children update in lock step? What happens in concurrent mode when we are interrupted when rendering only the first one? We have just created a mess that's impossible by construction under the current world of lazy-evaluation of JSX. The abstraction becomes harmfully leaky.

## But what if?

Would this be salvaged by fancier static typing? We know that rendering two copies of the resolved jsx can be problematic. The situation is similar to shared mutability, which is banned by Rust's type system. A Rust style type system could be used to ban this specific problematic usage.

Nevertheless, the underlying issue persists. It is also not a good idea to not render it, since somewhere inside the fully resolved jsx, some components might subscribe to a parent context. When the context changes, the orphaned `resolved` will be pushed with an updated value, which wastes computation power. More chaos will follow if we try to render only part of `resolved`.

Perhaps all of this can be linted against or banned by a smart enough type checker, and we can make this work. However, it can still degrade performance. Fully resolving a children is a work unit that cannot be interrupted, which undos all the optimization of [React 16 Fiber rewrite](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture). It is also not compatible with concurrent rendering, since concurrent rendering might require some rendering work to be cancelled. You can find more reasons why this should not be done in Dan Abramov's [React as a UI runtime blog post](https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/).

I have not spent enough time learning the internals of React, so I cannot conclude that this absolutely cannot be done. If I have to take an education guess, I would say that it will probably never happen. Even if someone managed to do it, the resulting framework and paradigm will be nothing like the current React.

## A much easier solution

I have showed that eager evaluation of JSX is a bad idea, but what about the problem mentioned above? Well, it can be solved by just changing the API:

```tsx
import type {ReactNode} from 'react';

function MyFlexibleContainer({
  useMaterialWrapper,
  children,
}: {
  useMaterialWrapper: boolean;
  children: ReactNode;
}) {
  if (useMaterialWrapper) {
    return (
      <MaterialDesignContainer>
        {children}
      </MaterialDesignContainer>
    );
  }

  return <div>{children}</div>;
}
```

The behavior of the component also just becomes more obvious in the type signature.
