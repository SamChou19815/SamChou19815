## Learning CS

This list contains some websites that I helped create and maintain. They may contain some useful
information for CS starters.

- [dev.cornelldti.org](https://dev.cornelldti.org/): The developer website I built for my project
  team at Cornell. It contains a lot of basic tutorial to my team members. It also contains links to
  slides of our internal learning workshops (called DevSesh internally).
- [Trends in Web Development](https://webdev.cornelldti.org/): The web development course that my
  project team runs at Cornell. It covers how you do webdev in React and NodeJS.

## Management of CS related organizations

This list contains some blog post with my experiences of managing CS related orgs. Some are
successful, some are not.

- [Computerization in High Schools](https://blog.developersam.com/2018/12/31/cs-in-high-schools/):
  My thoughts on the sad realities of CS in high schools settings. Covers some of my thoughts on
  club management decisions.
- [One Year as Developer Lead](https://blog.developersam.com/2020/05/14/one-year-as-dev-lead/):
  Covers a much more successful experience of myself as developer lead at Cornell DTI. Do not take
  everything in the post as absolute guideline. Remember that my project team has a much better
  engineer pool than Computerization.

## Software engineering blog posts

This list contains my blog posts on engineering topics. These blog posts are written with the
assumption that the audidence has a solid CS fundamentals and some software engineering experiences.
Some blog posts even cover topics like programming language theory that are unfamiliar to most
people. Don't feel bad if you can't understand every part of it.
