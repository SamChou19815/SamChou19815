## Repository convention

- All configuration that can potentially affect the entire repository must be inside `configuration`
  directory.
- Packages installed and managed by latest Yarn v2 release.
- Must use Yarn v2's workspace feature.
- Root workspace has `format:check`, `lint`, and `test` command.
- Managed by dev-sam's `monorail` tool.
- Each workspace follows a set of naming conventions.
  - Tooling workspace names must start with a predefined set of prefix.
  - Library workspace names must start with `lib-`
  - The rest workspaces are interpreted as deployable projects.
  - Each workspace must have a `compile` job.
  - Each project workspaces must have a `build` and `deploy` job, which will run in CI stage to
    deploy to production.
  - Each commit to master will be automatically pushed to production. No staging.

## `monorail` monorepo tool

:::caution
This document might not be as updated as latest monorail build. Only documented features here is
guaranteed to be _relatively_ stable.

### Installation

Download the self-contained
[code](https://github.com/SamChou19815/website/blob/master/packages/monorail/bin/monorail) checked
in the repo, and run it directly. You might need to reset the executable bit.

You can add `monorail` to your `PATH` so that you can directly run `monorail`.

### Configuration

Your root `package.json` should contain at least two sections:

```json
{
  // ...

  // Used for detecting workspace root.
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"],
  //
  "repoToolsConfiguration": {
    "binary": "relative/path/to/monorail/binary",
    "organizationName": "your-github-username-or-organization-name",
    "toolingPrefixes": ["anything-that-can-be-tooling-workspace-prefix"]
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Static code generation

Running `monorail` or `monorail codegen` will generate following files:

- `.github/workflows/generated-*.yml`: a set of generated GitHub Action workflows that assume the
  repository layout described above and are dependency-aware.
- `.eslintignore`, `.prettierignore`: generated by appending `configuration/styleignore.additions`
  to `.gitignore`.
- `configuration/libraries.json`: a json array specifying the names of library workspaces.

### Cached rebuild

Running `monorail rebuild` or `monorail r` will rebuild some generated code according to the
following rules:

If a workspace has a `codegenConfiguration` that has the format:

```json
{
  "sources": "<source directory or single source file>",
  "output": "path to a single output file"
}
```

Then rebuild will invoke the `codegen` script in the workspace. It will only rebuild if one of
the specified source file's modified time is newer than the generated output.
