This update changes the method/function access syntax from `a::b()` to `a.b()` to be consistent
with most programming language.

Now `samlang` will no longer error on insufficient context for type inference when a generic type
cannot be inferred from context. Instead, it will treat them as `int`.

Finally, type query and autocompletion are implemented with the newly introduced language server.
The VSCode extension will run `samlang lsp` to take advantage of that.
