title: Version 0.4.0
---

This release contains the latest rewrite of the samlang backend to target LLVM instead of X86, due
to Apple's switch to ARM chips.

A few more loop optimizations have been added, and all the old optimizations are done on the
high-level IR instead, making the emitted JavaScript code highly optimized.
