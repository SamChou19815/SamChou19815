title: Alpha Version 0.0.2

This update changes the design of the language.

Now the syntax of the method access changes from `expr.methodName` to `expr::methodName`, and the
dot syntax now means field access. Therefore, you now have two ways to access a field:

```samlang
function oldWay(): int =
    val { age } = this;
    age

// shorter and cleaner in this case
function newWay(): int = this.age
```

Docs on the website and the test cases have been updated.
