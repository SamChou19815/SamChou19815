This is the zeroth post in my blog. It is a Hello World post, but I will also use this post to test
various features of Jekyll.

<!--truncate-->

Here is a Hello World code snippet in my own programming language
[SAMPL](https://github.com/SamChou19815/SAMPL) that is currently under development:

```kotlin
// Simplest Program in SAMPL
class HelloWorld {
  fun main(): Unit = printlnString("Hello, Sam!")
}
```

I will write a post about this project in a few days.
